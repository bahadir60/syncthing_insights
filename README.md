## Goal

This is a demo code which is added on Syncthing (https://syncthing.net/) 

## What's change?

- `syncthing > gui > default > index.html` (modified)
- `syncthing > gui > default > insights.html` (added)
- `syncthing > gui > default > syncthing > core > syncthingController.js` (modified)

Needed Highchart scripts not downloaded and added to `vendor`, instead it uses internet adresses (so needed internet connection).
